Science Communication 101: Description: Sure, your research is the most exciting and important science out there! But to have an impact, it must be communicated in ways that enable people to understand and compel them to care. This workshop will combine empirical evidence gained from science communication research with fun, engaging activities to provide you with strategies and approaches to help you communicate your work effectively to diverse audiences. It will also explore specific strategies for communicating “controversial” science in non-controversial, non-confrontational ways.),  (2.Command-Line Bioinformatics for Beginners: Description: A day-long workshop that will teach 40 beginners the basics of command line programming and pipeline use for biological data. A short application is required separate from conference registration (see below), with preference given to individuals with limited access to bioinformatics resources at their current institution and/or are graduate students. $100 travel waivers are available for those with financial needs. ),  (3.Strategies for Responding to Harassment and Bullying: Improving Workplace Climate :Description: This interactive workshop describes academic practices and institutional structures that allow for sexual harassment and other hostile behaviors, including bullying, to persist, discusses initiatives to address these as research misconduct, and provides training in personal intervention strategies to protect and support targets of harassment. As a result of this session, participants will be able to identify: (1) different ways in which sexual and other types of harassment can manifest in research environments, including fieldwork; (2) strategies for bystander intervention, and (3) resources for cultural change in academic institutions, field research environments, and professional societies. This workshop was developed by the ADVANCEGeo Partnership.​​),   (4.Leveraging your PhD: Careers in and out of Academia: Description: The key goals of the workshop are to guide students and postdocs through the first steps of personal career exploration and necessary actions for active planning of post-graduate school or post-postdoctoral stages. In addition to small-group conversations with professionals from various careers, the session will include interactive presentations on professional branding/ marketing, networking, informational interviews, etc. Participants will leave the workshop with resources and assets to leverage against their job search.  Based on our past workshops, we expect that workshop attendees will experience greater confidence regarding career options, and with actionable items and strategies for successive efforts. ),  (5. Reproducibility for Everyone: Description: Rigor and reproducibility are at the core of modern science and set apart scientific inquiry from pseudoscience. Several new initiatives and tools have been established to address barriers to reproducibility. While very welcome, these projects have led to a proliferation of online tools and resources which can be hard to sift through. This workshop will introduce you to reproducible workflows and a range of tools along the themes of organization, documentation, analysis, and dissemination.),  (6. Undergraduate Diversity at Evolution: Career Development Workshop: Description: This workshop is part of the Undergraduate Diversity at Evolution program which provides funds for travel, lodging, and meeting registration for undergraduate students in an effort to increase diversity. The workshop will cover topics such as networking at conferences and applying to graduate school, and is open to all undergraduates, even those not part of the UDE program.​ Lunch is provided. In the afternoon the group will be taking a field trip to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.),  (7. Professional Development for Undergraduate Educators: Evolution of Data in the Classroom: From Data to Data Science: Description: There is increased interest in including data science education in biology,  building on existing initiatives to enhance quantitative skills and increase experience with real data, and leveraging access to large biological data sets and computational analysis of data.  Basic quantitative skills and ability to work with data are important parts of data acumen – the foundational skills that allow students to engage in data science practices. This workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss relevant data science practices and skills for biology students to master, and resources for teaching those skills. ),  (8. Peer Review in the Journal Evolution: A Primer for Students: Description: Are you a trainee who would like to get the publication and peer review process demystified, specifically in regard to the journal Evolution? Come to this informal short session to get your questions answered and to chat with some of the editorial board.),   (9. Public Policy Panel Discussion: Description​: Are you interested in promoting scientific research to the public and legislators, but are not sure how to get started? This event, which will feature a panel of experts in science policy, will equip you with the tools you need to begin engaging with key decision makers in your community.),  (10. Evolution Film Festival: Description: One of the highlights of the conference that should not be missed! We asked the science and science education communities to tell a story about evolution in 3 minutes or less using animation, art, music, dance, etc. Join us for an evening of terrifically informative and entertaining videos, while enjoying free popcorn and beer/wine/soda. To learn more and see past years’ entries, go to evolutionfilmfestival.org and follow #evofilmfest on Twitter.), (11. iEvoBio Software Bazaar: Description: iEvoBio is a satellite event bringing together evolutionary biologists who work on a broad spectrum of problems involving computation, mathematics and statistics. More information at the iEvoBio website. Registration for iEvoBio includes two events: the Software Bazaar and a post-conference workshop. The Software Bazaar is similar to a poster session, but presenters have laptops to show off their software instead of posters. Presenters are expected to bring their own laptops. The Software Bazaar is free to participate.) three more days of workshops here: https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/workshops-and-special-events.html'

(B)Ruth Patrick Student Poster award: The Ruth Patrick Student Poster Award was established in 2012 to recognize a student member of the American Society of Naturalists who has presented an outstanding poster at the annual meeting. Student members can indicate their eligibility for this award if they submit a poster before the early registration deadline (April 15, 2020). Ruth Patrick was a renowned limnologist, past president of the ASN (1975), and a Lifetime Honorary Member of the society. The winner of the award receives $1,000. Students will be asked to indicate their eligibility for this award during the poster submission process. Poster submission is only available after your main registration has been completed.)     (2. Evolutionary Biologists with Disabilities and Allies Coffee Mixer: Description​: Interested in meeting fellow evolutionary biologists with disabilities, chronic illness, Deaf folks, and interested allies? Want to discuss increasing the inclusion and representation of disabled students and staff in our diverse field? This is an informal chance to meet others interested in these topics, share experiences of disability in evolutionary biology, and hopefully increase our inclusion around issues of disability as a community. Anyone at any career stage and level of ability (including allies) is welcome to come join us.). (3. Women in Science Coffee Social: Description: This event offers an opportunity for attendees who identify as women or minoritized genders to meet, network, and discuss their experiences.
